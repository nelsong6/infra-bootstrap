# Shared Infrastructure - Core Resources
# ============================================================================
# This file contains only shared infrastructure resources that are used
# across multiple applications. App-specific resources should use the
# azure-app module in their respective repositories.
# ============================================================================

# Resource Group
# ============================================================================
# The resource group is created by bootstrap.ps1 and referenced here as data
# source. This allows the bootstrap process to manage the RG lifecycle while
# Terraform can use it for deploying resources.

# ============================================================================
# DNS Zone
# ============================================================================
# The DNS zone is the shared domain infrastructure (romaine.life) used by
# all applications. Each app creates its own subdomains under this zone.
